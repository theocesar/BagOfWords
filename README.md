# BagOfWords
 
Algorithm that implements a NLP(natural language processing) statistical language model, called Bag of Words.

## In depth explanation:

The algorithm should generate the document term matrix from the documents retrieved from the internet and
print this matrix on the screen. 

To do so:

a) Consider that all sentence lists should be transformed into lists of vectors,
where each item is one of the words of the sentence.

b) All the vectors must be joined into a single corpus forming a list of vectors,
where each item is a lexeme.

c) This single corpus will be used to generate the vocabulary.

d) The expected result will be a term-document matrix created by applying the
bag of Words technique on the whole corpus.
